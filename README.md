# student-performance-linear-regression
Linear Regression model that studies students' habits and predicts their exam performance


This project applies **Linear Regression** to study students' habits and analyze their impact on exam performance.  
The goal is to understand which lifestyle and study factors have the most significant effect on students’ results.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset includes various student-related factors such as:
- Age  
- Gender  
- Study hours per day  
- Social media and Netflix hours  
- Part-time job  
- Attendance percentage  
- Internet quality  
- Mental health rating  
- Extracurricular participation  
- Lifestyle  

The **target variable** is the students’ exam performance.

## 📊 Results
- **R² Score**: 0.86 → strong predictive ability  
- **MSE**: 37.35  
- Key insights:  
  - More study hours → higher performance  
  - Excessive social media/Netflix hours → lower performance  
  - Attendance and lifestyle had a positive effect
